  <h1>Trap Cards ‚Äì Game Rules</h1>

  <h2>üß© What You Need</h2>
  <p>A standard 52-card deck (without Jokers).<br>
  Suitable for <strong>2 to 8 players</strong>.</p>

  <h2>üåü Goal of the Game</h2>
  <p>Your objective is to score as few points as possible. If a player reaches <strong>exactly 100 points</strong>, their score drops to 50. If they go over 100, they are eliminated. The game ends when only one player remains or the lowest score wins.</p>

  <h2>üÉé Setup</h2>
<p>One player shuffles the deck and deals <strong>4 face-down cards</strong> to each player. Players place their cards in a square formation in front of them <em>without looking at them</em>.</p>
<p>Each player may then <strong>secretly look at 2 of their 4 cards</strong> ‚Äî only once ‚Äî and must memorize them before placing them back face-down in the same spot. They are not allowed to show them to other players.</p>
<p>Place the <strong>draw pile</strong> in the center of the table (face-down), and <strong>flip the top card</strong> to form the <strong>visible discard pile</strong> next to it.</p>

  <h2>üÉè Card Values</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Red King</strong>: 0 points</li>
    <li><strong>Black King</strong>: 13 points</li>
    <li><strong>Queen</strong>: 12 points ‚Äì if played on the visible discard pile, allows you to peek at one card</li>
    <li><strong>Jack</strong>: 11 points ‚Äì allows you to swap two cards (except with a player who has declared ‚ÄúStop‚Äù)</li>
    <li><strong>Ace</strong>: 1 point</li>
    <li><strong>2 to 10</strong>: face value</li>
    <li><strong>Joker</strong>: ‚Äì1 point ‚Äî a rare bonus if you choose to include the Jokers in your game.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚ú® Powers sum up</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Queen</strong>: lets you look at one of your hidden cards</li>
    <li><strong>Jack</strong>: lets you swap two players‚Äô cards (not involving someone who said "Stop")</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚ú® Optional Card Powers Variant</h2>
  <p><em>This variant introduces new powers assigned to specific cards. It can either replace or complement the standard rules above.</em></p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>7, 8</strong>: Look at one of your own face-down cards and place it back in the same spot, still face-down.</li>
    <li><strong>9, 10</strong>: Look at one face-down card belonging to an opponent and return it to its place.</li>
    <li><strong>Jacks, Queens</strong>: <em>Blind swap</em> ‚Äî Swap two random cards between any two players (you don‚Äôt look at them).</li>
    <li><strong>Kings</strong>: <em>Peek and swap</em> ‚Äî Look at any one card, then optionally swap it with another one.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üõ†Ô∏è Turn Overview</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Draw a card (from the deck or discard pile) ‚Äî <em>you may look at the card you draw</em></li>
    <li>Swap it with one of your cards or place it face-up on the discard pile</li>
    <li>Use a special power if it's a Queen or Jack</li>
    <li>If any of your known cards match the visible discard card, you may discard it immediately</li>
    <li>You may call "Stop" if you think you have the lowest score</li>
  </ol>

  <h2>üó£Ô∏è Saying "Stop"</h2>
  <p>Other players each take one final turn. Then, if the player who said "Stop" has the lowest score:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>‚úÖ Correct: <strong>-10 points</strong></li>
    <li>‚ùå Wrong: <strong>+10 points</strong></li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚ö° Quick Discard</h2>
  <p>Whenever a card is discarded during a player's turn, any other player may instantly discard one of their own cards if it has the same value.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If correct: their card is discarded and removed.</li>
    <li>If incorrect: they return the card to their layout and receive a penalty card <strong>without looking at it</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üîé Discarding for Another Player</h2>
  <p>If you have seen or memorized a card belonging to another player (via a Queen, a mistake, or a previous swap), and that player misses a chance to discard it when the opportunity arises, you may discard it on their behalf.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>If correct: their card is discarded, and <strong>they receive a penalty card</strong>.</li>
    <li>If incorrect: <strong>you receive a penalty card</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üìà Scoring (End of Round)</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Reveal your cards</li>
    <li>Add up the card values</li>
    <li>Above 100: eliminated / Exactly 100: reset to 50</li>
    <li>Apply "Stop" bonus/penalty</li>
  </ul>
  <div class="example">
    <strong>Example (end of round 1):</strong><br>
    Alice: 2, 7, Queen, Red King = 21 (called "Stop" and was right) ‚Üí 11 points<br>
    Bob: Jack, 3, 4, 5 = 23 points<br>
    Carla: Black King, 2, 9, 4 = 28 points
